                        <p>
                        PDFNet SDK is a high-quality, industry-strength PDF library meeting requirements of the most demanding and diverse applications. Using PDFNet you can write stand-alone, cross-platform, and reliable commercial applications that can read, write, edit, print and display PDF documents. PDFNet SDK is available as a .NET component and as a cross-platform Java and C/C++ PDF library available on a wide range of platforms (i.e. Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows Mobile, iOS, Android etc).

                        <h1>Note about version 6.1.0</h1>
                        <p>
                        PDFNet for Android is now available in a new <b>Standard</b> feature reduced variant (a.k.a. 'lean'). The Standard library offers the same viewing, annotation, and editing capabilities of the fully featured library however much smaller. The parts that are missing are relatively rarely used components:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Convert, Optimizer, Redactor, Stamper, Flattener classes</li>
                            <li>PDF/A validation/conversion</li>
                            <li>Converting PDF pages to TIFF and PNG formats (ie, PDFDraw will not work when using these formats)</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The <b>Full</b> variant, also found in the <a href="Lib/">Lib</a> folder, contains all the features above. Another change for this version is that embedded fonts, CMaps, and standard PDF resources were separated from the libraries into a file ('pdfnet.res') that can be shared among multiple .so libs. Check the <a href="#Resource">Resource</a> section for more information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Starting with 6.1.0 the library only supports Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) or higher.
                        </p>

                        </ul>


                        <h1>Lib</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contains the PDFNet library (PDFNet.jar) for <a href="./Doc/pdftron/PDF/PDFViewCtrl.html">PDFViewCtrl</a> class. The libraries support Android 2.3 or higher.</li>
                            <li>Contains the native Standard and Full libraries 'armeabi/libPDFNetC.so' (arm version), 'armeabi-v7a/libPDFNetC-v7a.so' (arm-v7 version), and 'x86/libPDFNetC.so' (x86 version). Note that the x86 library has only been tested on Android 4.1 (API 16).</li>
                            <li>To use the SDK you will need to compile with API level 11 (or higher) as the SDK uses some Honeycomb features if those are present at run-time.</li>
                            <li>Also note that it will be necessary to add to your res/raw folder the PDFNet resources file ("pdfnet.res"). This file contains information about embedded fonts, etc. Please, see <a href="#Resource">Resource</a> section for more information.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h1 id="Resource">Resource</h1>
                        <p>
                        Contains the PDFNet resources file that contains information about embedded fonts, CMaps, and standard PDF resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This file was included to allow developers to have more control over the size of the generated APK. If you want to create an APK with two or more shared libraries (let's say, for arm and arm-v7) you need to include the resources only once.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        To correctly view generic PDF documents you must load the external resources file using one of the following options:
                        <ul>
                            <li>PDFNet.initialize() includes an extra parameter that can be used to load the resource file from the application bundle. For example: PDFNet.initialize(this, R.raw.pdfnet). This method will copy the file from 'res/raw/pdfnet.res' to the private storage area of the app (Context.openFileOutput()). An exception will be thrown if there is no sufficient space to save the file, or if the resource ID can't be found. Please note that the resource file must be named "pdfnet.res" when using this approach.</li>
                            <li>PDFNet.initialize(Context) as before followed by PDFNet.setResourcesPath("path/to/resources/file"). With this method you are handling installation of the resource file on your own. For example, the resource file can be downloaded on demand and saved at any location. When the resource file is ready for use it can be loaded using PDFNet.setResourcesPath().</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h1>How to Build with Eclipse</h1>
                        It is convenient to build and debug an Android project using Google's ADT Plugin. The following steps brief how to build, say PDFViewCtrlDemo and PDFViewCtrlTools, using Eclipse with ADT.
                        <p/>
                        If you still do not have the IDE installed, we suggest using the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">ADT Bundle</a>.
                        <p/>
                        First we need to build the PDFViewCtrlTools library:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Copy the PDFNet.jar file from 'Lib' to the PDFViewCtrlTools's 'libs' folder. You only need this jar file to build the Tools library because this project will not be executed as an Android application.</li>
                            <li>In Eclipse, go to 'File -> New -> Project...' and select 'Android -> Android Project from Existing code'.</li>
                            <li>Select the PDFViewCtrlTools folder as the root directory and click 'Finish'.</li>
                            <li>Right click the project 'PDFViewCtrlTools' in the Package Explore panel and select 'Properties'.</li>
                            <li>Under the 'Android' category, make sure the 'Is Library' checkbox is checked and if a target API is selected.</li>
                            <li>You now are ready to build the library.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p/>
                        Now we will add the PDFViewCtrlDemo project into Eclipse:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You don't need to copy the PDFNet.jar again into this project, since we will referece the Tools project later. But you must add to your project the native library(ies). Copy the content from 'Lib\Standard' or 'Lib\Full' to the PDFViewCtrlDemo's 'libs' folder. Your project libs folder should have something like this structure:
                            <ul>
                                <li>libs\armeabi\libPDFNetC.so</li>
                                <li>libs\armeabi-v7a\libPDFNetC-v7a.so</li>
                                <li>libs\x86\libPDFNetC.so</li>
                                <li>libs\android-support-v4.jar</li>
                            </ul>
                            You can copy all the subfolders ('armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a' and 'x86') to make the output apk compatible on all platforms. Android will load the proper library during installation. If you know which platform is targeted, you only need to copy one of them.</li>
                            <li>In Eclipse, go to 'File -> New -> Project...' and select 'Android -> Android Project from Existing code'.</li>
                            <li>Select the PDFViewCtrlDemo folder as the root directory and click 'Finish'.</li>
                            <li>Now we need to reference the Tools library. Right click the project 'PDFViewCtrlDemo' in the Package Explore panel and select 'Properties'.</li>
                            <li>Under the 'Android' category, in the Library section, click 'Add...'</li>
                            <li>The next dialog should show all the projects opened in Eclipse that are marked as 'Is Library'. Choose PDFViewCtrlTools and click 'OK'.</li>
                            <li>The Library section should show now the PDFViewCtrlTools in the list, and if everything is correct a green check will be shown. Please note that Eclipse will not work correctly if the library project being referenced is not placed in the same drive, since Eclipse/Android do not use the full path.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Now, you are ready to build and run the project given that you have an Android device available. You can use either a <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/devices/index.html">virtual device</a> or a <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html">hardware device</a>.

                        <br/><br/>

                        <h1>Using ProGuard</h1>
                        If you plan to use ProGuard on your APK before releasing your app, you will need to add to your proguard configuration file the following lines:
                        <ul>
                            <li>-keep class pdftron.PDF.PDFViewCtrl$RenderCallback { *; }</li>
                            <li>-keep class pdftron.Filters.CustomFilter$CustomFilterCallback { *; }</li>
                            <li>-keep class pdftron.PDF.ProgressMonitor { *; }</li>
                            <li>-keep class pdftron.SDF.ProgressMonitor { *; }</li>
                        </ul>
                        This will ensure that the native calls to the rendering callback will not be obfuscated.

                        <br/><br/>
